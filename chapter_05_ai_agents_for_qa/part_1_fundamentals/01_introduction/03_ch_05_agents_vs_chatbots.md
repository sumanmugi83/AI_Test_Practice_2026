## 🤖 Detailed Breakdown

### Chatbot
```
User: "What's your return policy?"
Bot:  "Our return policy is 30 days..."
```
- **Purpose:** Answer questions
- **Autonomy:** None (responds only)
- **Tools:** None
- **Memory:** Session only

### Assistant
```
User: "Set a reminder for 3pm"
Asst: "Done! I'll remind you at 3pm"
```
- **Purpose:** Help with simple tasks
- **Autonomy:** Low (follows commands)
- **Tools:** Limited (calendar, timer)
- **Memory:** Some persistence

### Copilot
```
Developer: // function to validate email
Copilot:   function validateEmail(email) { ... }
```
- **Purpose:** Augment human work
- **Autonomy:** Medium (suggests, doesn't execute)
- **Tools:** Code completion
- **Memory:** File context

### Agent
```
User: "Test the login flow and report bugs"
Agent: [Reads spec] → [Writes tests] → [Runs Playwright] 
       → [Finds bug] → [Creates Jira ticket] → [Notifies team]
```
- **Purpose:** Complete tasks autonomously
- **Autonomy:** High (plans, decides, executes)
- **Tools:** Many (APIs, DBs, browsers, code)
- **Memory:** Short-term + Long-term
