## 📅 Timeline of AI Agents

### 1950s-1960s: Early AI
- **1956:** AI term coined at Dartmouth Conference
- **Expert Systems:** Rule-based decision making
- Example: Medical diagnosis systems

### 1980s-1990s: Symbolic Agents
- **SOAR (1983):** Cognitive architecture
- **ACT-R (1993):** Human cognition model
- Simple agents in games and simulations

### 2000s: Multi-Agent Systems
- **Swarm intelligence**
- **Distributed AI**
- Robots and autonomous vehicles

### 2010s: ML-Powered Agents
- **Deep Learning revolution**
- **AlphaGo (2016):** Agents beat humans
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Agents learn from rewards

### 2020s: LLM-Powered Agents
- **GPT-3 (2020):** Language understanding
- **ChatGPT (2022):** Conversational AI
- **AutoGPT (2023):** First autonomous LLM agents
- **MCP (2024):** Standardized tool protocol
- **Claude, GPT-4, Gemini:** Modern agent platforms
