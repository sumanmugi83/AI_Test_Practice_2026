## 📖 Agent Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | An autonomous AI system that can perceive, reason, plan, and act |
| **LLM** | Large Language Model - the reasoning engine powering agents |
| **Tool** | A function an agent can call to interact with external systems |
| **ReAct** | Reasoning + Acting pattern for agent execution |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol - standard for agent tool integration |
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation - enhancing agents with knowledge |
| **Vector DB** | Database for semantic search (Pinecone, Chroma) |
| **Embedding** | Numerical representation of text for similarity search |
| **Context Window** | Maximum tokens an LLM can process at once |
| **Prompt** | Input instruction to an LLM |
| **System Prompt** | Instructions defining agent behavior |
| **Hallucination** | When an agent generates false information |
| **Guardrail** | Safety measure to constrain agent behavior |
| **HITL** | Human-in-the-Loop - requiring human approval |
| **Chain** | Sequence of LLM calls for complex tasks |
| **Memory** | Agent's ability to remember past interactions |
| **Short-term Memory** | Current session context |
| **Long-term Memory** | Persistent storage across sessions |
| **Episodic Memory** | Memory of past events |
| **Semantic Memory** | Memory of facts and knowledge |
| **Multi-Agent** | Multiple agents working together |
| **Supervisor** | Agent that manages other agents |
| **Worker** | Agent that performs specific tasks |
| **Swarm** | Collection of agents with collective intelligence |
| **Orchestration** | Coordinating multiple agents |
| **Function Calling** | LLM capability to invoke functions |
| **Structured Output** | LLM generating JSON/structured data |
| **Token** | Basic unit of text processing (~4 characters) |
| **Temperature** | Randomness in LLM output (0=deterministic) |
| **Autonomous** | Operating without human intervention |
| **Agentic** | Having agent-like capabilities |
