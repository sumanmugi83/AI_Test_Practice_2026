## 🎯 Overview

Reasoning is how agents think through problems. Different reasoning strategies produce different quality outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Reasoning Strategies

### 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Think step by step.

```
Task: "Prioritize these 5 bugs"

CoT Reasoning:
1. First, I'll read each bug description
2. Then, I'll assess severity based on impact
3. Next, I'll consider dependencies
4. Finally, I'll rank by priority

Result: [Prioritized list with reasoning]
```

### 2. Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

Explore multiple paths.

```
Task: "How to test the payment flow?"

           ┌─── Test via UI ─── Slow but comprehensive
           │
Decision ──┼─── Test via API ─── Fast but limited
           │
           └─── Hybrid ─── Best of both ✓
```

### 3. Self-Reflection

Critique and improve.

```
Initial Answer: "Run all 500 tests"

Self-Critique: "That's inefficient. Only payment 
               changed, so only payment tests needed"

Improved Answer: "Run 47 payment-related tests"
```

### 4. ReAct (Reason + Act)

Interleave thinking and acting.

```
Thought: I need to check if login tests exist
Action: list_files("tests/login/")
Observation: Found 12 test files
Thought: Now I should check test coverage
Action: run_coverage("tests/login/")
...
```

## 🎯 QA Reasoning Examples

| Task | Reasoning Approach | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Bug prioritization | CoT | Step-by-step evaluation |
| Test strategy | ToT | Explore options |
| Flaky test analysis | Self-Reflection | Verify conclusions |
| Exploratory testing | ReAct | Interactive discovery |
