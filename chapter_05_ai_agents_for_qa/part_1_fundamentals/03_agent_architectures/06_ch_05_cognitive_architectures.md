## 🎯 Overview

Modern AI agents build on decades of cognitive science research. Understanding these foundations helps design better agents.

## 🧠 Key Cognitive Architectures

### ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)

- Developed at Carnegie Mellon
- Models human cognition with modules
- Declarative + Procedural memory

### SOAR (State, Operator And Result)

- General problem-solving architecture
- Learning through chunking
- Goal-driven behavior

### BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)

- Beliefs: What the agent knows
- Desires: Goals to achieve
- Intentions: Committed plans

## 🔗 Connection to LLM Agents

| Cognitive Concept | LLM Agent Equivalent |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Working memory | Context window |
| Long-term memory | Vector database |
| Procedural memory | Tools & functions |
| Goal stack | Task decomposition |
| Chunking | Prompt caching |

## 📝 Key Takeaway

LLM agents are the latest evolution of cognitive architectures, combining classical AI patterns with modern language understanding.
