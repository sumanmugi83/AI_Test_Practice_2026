## 🎯 Decision Guide

Use this flowchart to choose the right agent architecture:

```
START
  │
  ▼
Is the task simple (single step)?
  │
  ├── YES → Use Simple LLM Call (no agent needed)
  │
  └── NO ↓
          │
          ▼
     Does it need real-time response?
          │
          ├── YES → OODA Loop
          │
          └── NO ↓
                  │
                  ▼
             Is quality critical?
                  │
                  ├── YES → Reflection Pattern
                  │
                  └── NO ↓
                          │
                          ▼
                     Are steps clear upfront?
                          │
                          ├── YES → Plan-Execute
                          │
                          └── NO → ReAct
```

## 📊 Quick Reference

| Scenario | Architecture | Why |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| Generate test cases | ReAct | Interactive, needs tools |
| Setup full CI/CD | Plan-Execute | Many clear steps |
| Bug prioritization | Reflection | Accuracy matters |
| Live monitoring | OODA | Real-time |
| Complex workflow | Supervisor + Workers | Divide & conquer |

---

## 🎯 QA-Specific Recommendations

| QA Task | Best Choice |
|---------|-------------|
| Test generation | ReAct |
| Test suite setup | Plan-Execute |
| Bug triage | Reflection |
| Self-healing tests | ReAct |
| Pipeline monitoring | OODA |
| Full QA automation | Multi-Agent |
