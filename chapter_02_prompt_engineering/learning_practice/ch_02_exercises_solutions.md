## Exercise 1 Solution: Improve a Vague Prompt

**Improved Prompt:**
```
ROLE: You are a Senior QA Engineer.

CONTEXT: 
We are testing an e-commerce checkout application.
[Attach PRD or requirements]

TASK:
Generate 10 functional test cases for the checkout flow.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use ONLY provided requirements
- Do NOT assume undocumented features
- Mark gaps as "Needs clarification"

FORMAT:
| Test ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |

REQUIREMENTS:
[Paste requirements here]
```

## Exercise 2 Solution: Choose the Right Prompting Type

| Scenario | Answer | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Generate 5 basic login test cases | Zero-Shot | Simple, standard task |
| Analyze a complex bug | Chain-of-Thought | Requires reasoning |
| Custom company template | Few-Shot | Need format examples |
| Quick validation test | Zero-Shot | Simple and direct |
| Root cause analysis | Chain-of-Thought | Multi-step reasoning |

## Exercise 3 Solution: Fix the Hallucination-Prone Prompt

**Fixed Prompt:**
```
ROLE: You are a QA Engineer.

TASK: Generate test cases for the payment system.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use ONLY the provided payment documentation
- Do NOT assume payment methods not listed
- Do NOT invent error codes or messages
- Mark missing information as "[NOT SPECIFIED]"
- If unsure, state "Insufficient information"

FORMAT:
| Test ID | Category | Description | Expected Result |

PAYMENT DOCUMENTATION:
<<<

## Exercise 4 Solution: Create a Few-Shot Prompt

```
Generate API test cases following these examples:

EXAMPLE 1:
| TC_001 | DELETE /users/{id} | Valid user ID | 204 No Content | User deleted |

EXAMPLE 2:
| TC_002 | DELETE /users/{id} | Non-existent ID | 404 Not Found | Error message |

---

NOW GENERATE:
5 more DELETE endpoint test cases covering:
- Unauthorized access
- Invalid ID format
- Already deleted resource
- Missing authentication
- Rate limit exceeded
```

## Exercise 5 Solution: Build a Chain-of-Thought Prompt

```
TASK: Analyze test coverage for the login module.

Think through this step by step:

Step 1: List all login features from the requirements
Step 2: Map existing test cases to each feature
Step 3: Identify features without test coverage
Step 4: Identify missing edge cases and negative scenarios
Step 5: Prioritize coverage gaps by business risk

Final: Provide a coverage summary with recommendations.
