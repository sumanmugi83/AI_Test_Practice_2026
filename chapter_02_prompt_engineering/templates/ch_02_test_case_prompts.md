## Template 2: PRD to Test Cases (Comprehensive)

```
ROLE: You are a Senior QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience.

TASK: Generate comprehensive test cases from this PRD.

COVERAGE AREAS:
- Functional (happy path)
- Negative scenarios
- Boundary values
- Edge cases

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use ONLY PRD content
- No assumptions about unmentioned features
- Mark unclear items as "Needs clarification"
