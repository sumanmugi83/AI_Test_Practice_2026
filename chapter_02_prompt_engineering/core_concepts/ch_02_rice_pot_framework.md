## RICE - The Foundation

### R - Role (Expertise)

**What:** The professional identity and expertise level of the AI.

**Purpose:** Sets the knowledge domain and skill level.

```
ROLE: You are a Senior QA Engineer with 10+ years of experience 
in test automation and API testing.
```

**Examples:**
- "You are a Security Testing Specialist"
- "You are a Performance Engineer"
- "You are an Accessibility QA Expert"

---

### I - Intent (Why)

**What:** The purpose behind the request.

**Purpose:** Helps AI understand the goal, not just the task.

```
INTENT: I need to ensure complete test coverage before release 
to prevent production bugs.
```

**Examples:**
- "I need to validate API changes don't break existing integrations"
- "I want to identify security vulnerabilities before deployment"
- "I need to document test cases for audit compliance"

---

### C - Context (Background)

**What:** All relevant background information.

**Purpose:** Grounds the AI in your specific situation.

```
CONTEXT:
- Application: E-commerce checkout system
- Tech stack: React + Node.js
- Recent changes: Payment gateway integration
- PRD: [attached]
```

**Include:**
- PRD / Requirements
- API documentation
- Screenshots / Logs
- System constraints
- Previous issues

---

### E - Expected Output (Success Criteria)

**What:** What successful output looks like.

**Purpose:** Defines the quality bar and acceptance criteria.

```
EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- 10 test cases minimum
- Cover happy path and error scenarios
- Include boundary value tests
- Each test must be independently executable
```

---

## POT - The Refinement

### P - Persona / Parameters

**What:** Behavioral style OR constraints and rules.

**Purpose:** Controls HOW the AI approaches the task.

#### Option A: Persona (Behavior)

```
PERSONA: Be skeptical and thorough. Question every assumption.
Look for edge cases others might miss. Never accept requirements 
at face value.
```

#### Option B: Parameters (Constraints)

```
PARAMETERS:
- Use ONLY provided documentation
- Do NOT assume undocumented features
- Mark uncertainties as "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]"
- No hallucinations allowed
```

**Recommendation:** Use Parameters for QA tasks to prevent hallucinations.

---

### O - Output Format

**What:** The exact structure of the response.

**Purpose:** Makes output immediately usable.

```
OUTPUT FORMAT:
| Test ID | Category | Description | Steps | Expected Result | Priority |
```

**Formats:**
- Table / CSV
- JSON
- Bullet list
- Numbered steps
- Custom template

---

### T - Task (What to Do)

**What:** The specific action to perform.

**Purpose:** Clear, unambiguous instruction.

```
TASK: Generate 10 functional test cases for the checkout flow,
covering:
1. Happy path (successful purchase)
2. Payment failures
3. Cart edge cases
4. Session timeout
```
