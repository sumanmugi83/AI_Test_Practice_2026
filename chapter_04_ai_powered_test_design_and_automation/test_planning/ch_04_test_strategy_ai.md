## Test Plan vs Test Strategy

| Aspect | Test Plan | Test Strategy |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| **Focus** | What, when, who | How, why |
| **Level** | Project-specific | Organization or release level |
| **Scope** | Single project | Can span multiple projects |

| Strategy | Focus | Best For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Risk-Based** | Test highest-risk areas first | Complex applications |
| **Regression** | Protect existing features | Continuous delivery |
| **Exploratory** | Find unknown bugs | New features, UI testing |
| **Performance** | Speed, load, stress | High-traffic applications |

## Strategy 1: Risk-Based Testing

### Risk Assessment Matrix

```
RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX
=============================================
| Risk Area        | Severity | Likelihood | Priority | Action |
|------------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|
| Payment failure  | Critical | High       | P1       | Full automation |
| Auth bypass      | Critical | Medium     | P1       | Manual + Auto |
| Cart data loss   | High     | High       | P2       | Full automation |
| Search accuracy  | Medium   | Medium     | P3       | Manual |
| UI alignment     | Low      | High       | P4       | Visual regression |
| Performance degradation | High | Low    | P2       | Load testing |
```

### AI-Generated Risk Strategy

```text
RISK-BASED STRATEGY:

P1 - CRITICAL (Test First, Full Depth):
  → Payment: Test all payment flows including edge cases
    - Valid transactions across card types
    - Declined cards (insufficient funds, expired, invalid)
    - Timeout scenarios
    - Refund processing
    Automation: 100% of scenarios

  → Authentication: Full security testing
    - SQL injection on login fields
    - Session token manipulation
    - Concurrent session handling
    Automation: 80% functional, manual security probes

P2 - HIGH (Standard Depth):
  → Cart Persistence: Cross-session and cross-device
    - Login on one device, verify on another
    - Clear cache and verify persistence
    Automation: 90% of scenarios

  → Performance: Load testing at peak
    - 1000 concurrent users simulation
    - Cart operation under load
    Automation: Full load scripts (Playwright + k6)

P3 - MEDIUM (Smoke + Key Paths):
  → Search: Key flows and filter combinations
    Automation: Happy path only

P4 - LOW (Visual Only):
  → UI: Screenshot comparison
    Automation: Visual regression suite
```

## Strategy 2: Regression Testing Strategy

### When to Use

```
Regression strategy is critical for:
- After bug fixes (verify fix + no new bugs)
- After feature additions (existing features intact)
- Before releases (confidence gate)
- In continuous delivery (run every deployment)
```

### Regression Tier Structure

### AI Prompt for Regression Strategy

```text
Generate a regression test strategy for:

Application: E-Commerce Platform
Release frequency: Every 2 weeks
Previous high-severity bugs:
1. Payment timeout not handled
2. Cart items lost on page refresh
3. Search results showing wrong products

Define:
1. Regression suite priority levels
2. Which tests run every sprint vs. every release
3. Automation coverage targets
4. Time allocation for regression
5. How to prioritize when time is limited
```

### AI Output

```
REGRESSION STRATEGY:

TIER 1 - Run Every Deployment (Smoke):
  Duration: 15 minutes
  Coverage: Critical paths only
  - Login & logout
  - Add to cart & checkout

  - Payment success flow
  Tools: Playwright (automated)

TIER 2 - Run Every Sprint (Core Regression):
  Duration: 2 hours
  Coverage: All major features
  - Full authentication flow
  - All cart operations
  - Payment success + top 3 failure scenarios
  - Search + filter combinations
  Tools: Playwright (automated) + manual edge cases

TIER 3 - Run Every Release (Full Regression):
  Duration: Full day
  Coverage: 100% test suite
  - All scenarios including edge cases
  - Cross-browser testing
  - Performance baselines
  - Security scan
  Tools: Full automation suite + manual exploratory

PREVIOUS BUG REGRESSION (Always Run):

  - Cart persistence on refresh (TC-CART-023)
  - Search result accuracy (TC-SEARCH-041)
```

## Strategy 3: Shift-Left Testing Strategy

### What is Shift-Left?

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Traditional["Traditional Approach"]
        direction LR
        T1[Dev] --> T2[QA] --> T3[Release]
    end

    subgraph ShiftLeft["Shift-Left Approach"]
        direction LR
        S0[Test] --> S1[Dev] --> S2[QA] --> S3[Release]
    end

    style S0 fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#388e3c
    style Traditional fill:#ffebee
    style ShiftLeft fill:#e8f5e9
```

**Key Insight:** Testing moves earlier in the pipeline, catching bugs when they're cheapest to fix.

### AI Prompt

```text
Create a shift-left testing strategy for our DevOps pipeline:

Current pipeline stages:
1. Code commit
2. Build
3. Unit tests
4. Integration tests
5. Deploy to staging
6. QA testing
7. Deploy to production

Add testing activities at each stage using AI assistance.
Include: contract testing, security scanning, API mocking.
```
