## Discovery (Phase 1)
- **North Star:** Develop a Gherkin to Playwright (JS/TS) converter.
- **Integrations:** Convert Cucumber Gherkin code to Playwright.
- **Source of Truth:** User enters Gherkin code (UI/Input).
- **Delivery Payload:** New directory with converted files + UI display.
- **Behavioral Rules:** Prioritize readability over strict 1:1 mapping.

## Constraints
- Must use B.L.A.S.T. protocol.
- Must use A.N.T. architecture.
- Deterministic logic preferred (Note: Logic to parse Gherkin structure is deterministic; step implementation generation may require templates).
