## Definitions

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition:** The broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.

**Examples:**
- Chess-playing programs
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Self-driving cars
- Chatbots

**QA Relevance:** Any system claiming to be "AI-powered" falls under this umbrella.

---

### Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:** A subset of AI where systems **learn patterns from data** instead of being explicitly programmed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Learns from examples
- Improves with more data
- Makes predictions/decisions

**Examples:**
- Spam filters
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Image classification

**QA Relevance:** ML models need testing for accuracy, bias, and edge cases.

---

### Deep Learning (DL)

**Definition:** A subset of ML that uses **neural networks with multiple layers** (deep neural networks) to learn complex patterns.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses neural networks
- Requires large amounts of data
- Can learn hierarchical features
- Computationally intensive

**Examples:**
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Language translation
- LLMs (GPT, Claude, Llama)

**QA Relevance:** Deep learning models are black boxes—testing focuses on outputs, not logic.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | AI | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
|--------|----|--------------------|---------------|
| **Scope** | Broadest | Subset of AI | Subset of ML |
| **How it works** | Rules or learning | Learning from data | Neural networks |
| **Data needs** | Varies | Moderate | Very large |
| **Explainability** | Can be high | Moderate | Low (black box) |
| **Examples** | Expert systems, robots | Spam filters, recommendations | LLMs, image recognition |
| **Hardware** | Standard | Standard to GPU | GPU/TPU required |

---

## Where LLMs Fit

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT, Claude, and Llama are:

```
AI → ML → Deep Learning → Transformer Architecture → LLMs
```

**Key Points:**
- LLMs are a specific type of deep learning model
- They use the **Transformer architecture**
- Trained on massive text datasets
- Specialize in language understanding and generation

## Why QAs Need to Know This

| Concept | QA Implication |
|---------|----------------|
| **AI** | Understand the system's claims vs. reality |
| **ML** | Test for data bias, accuracy, edge cases |
| **Deep Learning** | Expect black-box behavior, test outputs |
| **LLMs** | Apply anti-hallucination rules, validate grounding |

---

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| "AI thinks like humans" | AI processes patterns, doesn't "think" |
| "ML is always accurate" | ML makes errors, especially on edge cases |
| "Deep Learning is magic" | It's math—lots of matrix operations |
| "LLMs understand meaning" | They predict likely next tokens |

## Quick Memory Aid

```
AI     = The whole kingdom
ML     = A province in AI that learns from data
DL     = A city in ML using neural networks
LLM    = A building in DL specialized in language
```

## Key Takeaway for QA

> **When testing AI systems:**
> - Understand which layer you're testing
> - ML models need data quality checks
> - Deep Learning models need output validation
> - LLMs need anti-hallucination enforcement
