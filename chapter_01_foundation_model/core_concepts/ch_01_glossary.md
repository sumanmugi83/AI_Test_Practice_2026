**Purpose:** Quick Reference for Key Terms
**Chapter:** 1 - Foundation Model

## Tokens & Input Processing

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Token** | The smallest unit processed by a model (word, subword, or character). |
| **Tokenization** | The process of converting raw input into tokens. |
| **Vocabulary** | The complete set of tokens a model can understand. |
| **Context Window** | The maximum number of tokens a model can consider at one time. |
| **Prompt** | The input provided to the model to guide its response. |
| **Completion** | The text generated by the model in response to a prompt. |

## Generation & Behavior

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Autoregressive Model** | Generates output token by token using only past tokens. |
| **Masked Language Model** | Predicts missing tokens using both past and future context. |
| **Probabilistic Output** | Model outputs are based on likelihoods, not certainty. |

---

## Training & Learning

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Training Data** | The data used to train the model. |
| **Parameters (Weights)** | Trainable values inside a model that store learned knowledge. |
| **Model Scale** | The size of a model, usually measured by parameter count. |
| **Supervised Learning** | Training using manually labeled input-output pairs. |
| **Self-Supervised Learning** | Training where labels are derived automatically from the data itself. |

## QA & Validation Terms (from Chapter 1 Files)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Hallucination** | When a model generates false or invented information not grounded in input. |
| **Grounding** | Ensuring output is traceable to provided input/evidence. |
| **Verified Facts** | Information explicitly confirmed from provided sources (PRD, logs, screenshots). |
| **Inference** | A conclusion drawn from evidence; must be labeled with confidence level. |
| **Deterministic Output** | Output that is consistent and repeatable given the same input. |
| **Self-Validation** | Process of checking own output for hallucinations or contradictions. |
| **Confidence Level** | Indicator of certainty (e.g., "low confidence" for inferences). |

---

## Input Sources (Scope of Knowledge)

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PRD** | Product Requirements Document - source of expected behavior. |
| **API Documentation** | Technical specification of endpoints, parameters, responses. |
| **Logs** | System-generated records of events, errors, and transactions. |
| **Test Data** | Data specifically prepared for testing scenarios. |

---

## Agent Architecture Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Guard Agent** | An agent that enforces validation rules before output is returned. |
| **Validation Check** | A specific rule that must pass before output is accepted. |
| **Grounding Check** | Validates that output is supported by provided input. |
| **Assumption Check** | Validates that all assumptions are explicitly labeled. |

│  ⚠️ Inference = Labeled with confidence                 │
│  ❌ Hallucination = Invented, not in input              │
