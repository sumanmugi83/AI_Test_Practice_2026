## Verification Test Prompt

Use this prompt to verify Kimi K2 is working correctly:

```text
Role: Senior QA Engineer
Task: Generate comprehensive test cases

Context:
I need test cases for a search functionality with:
- Text input field
- Filter dropdowns (category, date range, price)
- Sort options (relevance, date, price)
- Pagination (20 results per page)

Generate a complete test suite including:
1. Functional tests
2. Boundary tests
3. Integration tests between filters
4. Performance considerations

Format: Structured table with Test ID, Category, Description, Steps, Expected Result
```

**Expected Output:** A comprehensive table with 10+ test cases covering various scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Slow response on large context | Normal - wait for complete response |
| Language defaulting to Chinese | Set English in settings or specify in prompt |
| API rate limited | Wait or upgrade to paid tier |
| File upload fails | Check file size and format |
