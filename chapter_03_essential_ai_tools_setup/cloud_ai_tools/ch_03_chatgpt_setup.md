2. Add QA context:

**What would you like ChatGPT to know about you?**
```text
I am a QA Engineer working on test automation. I primarily use:
- Selenium/Playwright for UI testing
- Python/JavaScript for scripting
- REST APIs for backend testing
I follow the RICE POT framework for prompts.
```

**How would you like ChatGPT to respond?**
```text
- Provide structured test cases with clear steps
- Include both positive and negative scenarios
- Add assertions and expected results
- Use code blocks for test scripts
- Follow testing best practices
```

## QA-Specific Use Cases

### 1. Test Case Generation
```text
Generate test cases for an e-commerce checkout flow:
- Shopping cart with multiple items
- Shipping address form
- Payment processing (credit card)
- Order confirmation

Include boundary tests and error scenarios.
```

### 2. Test Data Generation
```text
Generate 10 rows of test data for user registration:
- Name (valid and invalid formats)
- Email (valid, invalid, edge cases)
- Phone (international formats)
- Age (boundary values)

Output as JSON.
```

### 3. API Test Script
```text
Write a Python requests script to test this API:
- POST /api/users
- Body: {"name": "string", "email": "string"}
- Expected: 201 Created

Include error handling and assertions.
```

### 4. Bug Report Writing
```text
Convert this informal bug description into a proper bug report:
"The submit button doesn't work sometimes on mobile"

Include: Summary, Steps, Expected, Actual, Environment, Severity
```

## Verification Test Prompt

Use this prompt to verify ChatGPT is working correctly:

```text
Act as a QA Engineer. Generate 3 test cases for a password reset feature.

Requirements:
- User enters email address
- System sends reset link (valid for 24 hours)
- Link redirects to password change form
- New password must be 8+ characters with 1 uppercase and 1 number
